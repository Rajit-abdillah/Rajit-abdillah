### ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rajit Abdillah

- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Front-End Development  
- ğŸŒ± Currently learning: React, Next.js, Sass
- ğŸ“« Reach me at: **abdillahrajit@gmail.com**  
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him dude/guy  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a fast learner in most things, but programming has challenged me in a unique way. It's been frustrating at times, but also incredibly satisfying when things gets done. I'm determined to grow into a skilled developer with strong learning and practice habits.
